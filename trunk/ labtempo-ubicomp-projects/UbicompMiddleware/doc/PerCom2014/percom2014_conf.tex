% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
Due to recent advances in mobile computing and wireless communication technologies, we can see the emergence of a favorable scenario for building ubiquitous/pervasive applications. This work proposes a new framework that aims at building those applications, providing a set of concepts and implementation tools. We propose abstractions that allow developers to handle the resources spread in the environment in a simple and homogeneous way, and to interpret context information. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, the concepts were implemented in a platform named \textit{SmartAndroid}. A ubiquitous applications prototyping interface was implemented over this platform to allow testing of different environment configurations before purchasing all devices; and also a context rules composition interface, where end users can define their preferences in the environment.

% Context awareness is reaching increasingly visibility in the current applications development scenario. The goal of this paper is to propose a new solution for representing, distributing and interpreting context informations, thus allowing the construction of applications for intelligent ambients. The infrastructure described in this paper exposes the ambient resources in a higher level, leading to a simpler and more dynamic creation of context rules; and by means of a graphical interface, end users are able to easily create and customize rules in the ambient. The proposed concepts have been implemented as a platform focused on building smart homes.
% 
% This article describes the Pervasive Applications Prototyping and Management Interface (IPGAP) that aims to provide a platform to support construction, test and execution of applications for smart ambients. In order to provide these features capabilities, our tool helps to perform simulation of sensors and actuators as well as means to visualize the interaction of real components which are inside the ambient. This way the developer will be able to construct applications without having a complete smart ambient infrastructure.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
The field of Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp), nowadays widely discussed, was first proposed by Mark Weiser in the 1990's~\cite{Weiser1991century}. Also referred by pervasive computing, the field aims at providing a different paradigm of human-machine interaction. As traditional applications provides services to users through their explicit interaction (using devices as mouse, keyword, monitor, for example), in ubiquitous applications the interaction happens without the need of explicit interaction, i.e. the application tries to discover the users needs through the acquisition of context (using sensors) and the knowledge of their preferences, and providing services in the environment (using actuators). These environments enhanced with sensors and actuators to provide automated services to persons are also called Intelligent Environments (IE).

% The construction of a ubiquitous application from the start is not a simple task, since the developer will have concerns from the communication level to the representation of resources in high level before even start programming the business logic of her application. 
The construction and manipulation of ubiquitous applications represent major challenges for developers, especially in terms of technical knowledge required and the availability of real devices during application development. Some of these challenges can be well highlighted: (i) there are difficulties in establishing a common protocol for communication between the components of the distributed system, because of the \textit{heterogeneity of devices} involved, (ii) the interactivity of ubiquitous applications is hampered depending on the amount and \textit{variety of context information and services} available in the environment, (iii) \textit{developing and testing applications} require high availability of resources, such as sensors (e.g. presence, lighting, temperature), actuators (e.g. keys, alarms, smart-tvs), including new embedded devices, or physical spaces, such as a house for applications of type smart home.

% From the Mark Weiser proposed in the 1990s, researchers in the field of ubicomp / pervasive have proposed changes in human-machine interaction, in order to make the use of devices increasingly transparent environment. This enables the user to focus on the task at hand and not the tool to do it. From these ideas came the concept of smart environments, where sensors and actuators interconnected network are able to provide relevant information about the environment to applications and users, and effectively act in this environment and change its state.



%FIXME: araujo é um artigo em PT, arrumar um em EN
In this work we propose a framework for developing ubiquitous applications in IE. The goal is to provide support for the programming, testing and execution of applications, thus allowing to deal consistently with systems great complexity. The framework stands out for addressing the challenges already identified in UbiComp~\cite{araujo2003}. The \textit{heterogeneity of devices} is handled through the definition of a Distributed Component Model, that provides abstractions to encapsulate these devices, also called resources, enabling developers to interact with them seamlessly. Regarding the \textit{variety of context information and services} issue, we propose a solution for context interpretation that allows developers to create and manage context rules at runtime, and users to set their preferences in the IE. Finally, regarding the issue on the \textit{resource availability}, the framework includes an application interface for the prototyping and management of pervasive applications (IPGAP), focused on visualization and testing ubiquitous applications, mixing real and virtual components.
%in which the basic component has a uniform structure defined as a Resource Agent (RA), formerly proposed in~\cite{cardoso2006} as an entity gathering context information. In this work, the RA, while maintaining context information, acts as a component that encapsulates the device code associated with it, including aspects of interaction with application components.

The concepts of the framework were materialized on a platform called \textit{SmartAndroid}\footnote{www.tempo.uff.br/smartandroid}, whose development has enabled appraisal in order to prove that the conceptual framework facilitates the process of building ubiquitous applications. We implemented some use cases to validate different aspects of the framework proposed and to testify its capabilities, supported by the elaboration of competency questions, which is a mechanism mostly used to evaluate ontologies, but can also be used as an assessment to this work.

% The concepts of the framework have been implemented on a platform called \textit{SmartAndroid}\footnote{www.tempo.uff.br/smartandroid} developed in the context of the project. The implementation of this project has enabled appraisal in order to prove that the conceptual framework facilitates the process of building ubiquitous applications.  One of the evaluations occurred during the processing of an application running on a purely local ubiquitous application. In another assessment, an application was built to verify the feasibility of implementation of Context Model, through the exploitation of communication mechanisms used in the Distributed Component Model.


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First we present in Section~\ref{sec:overview} an overview of the main concepts used as a basis for the framework's development. In Section~\ref{sec:framework}, we present the framework's overall architecture and main features. We then, in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}, present a proof of concept demonstrating the feasibility of building ubiquitous applications using the framework and we show examples of applications that explores the key features of the IE. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:related} we compare our approach with related work and in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} we conclude this paper with the main remarks.


\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related}
% [ubicomp is nice but it is not priceless]
The benefits to users and developers that UbiComp foresees reach beyond the horizon of many imaginative researchers. The possibilities that arise from it surpass the bounds established by keyboards and mice, our standard interfaces. Nonetheless, building such adaptable applications requires much effort from developers that see themselves immersed in a universe of device's specifications and communication technologies, apart from the problem itself that the application must solve. Therefore, many researchers have focused on diminishing those obstacles by providing abstractions, middlewares, services, tools, and other suportive techniques, not only for development but also for prototyping.

%ubicomp implies dealing with limited and dinamically varying computational resources [kindberg2002ieee]

Most approaches focus on one aspect of ubicomp, such as security~\cite{}, location~\cite{}, context representation~\cite{}, smarthome specific~\cite{dixon2012operating}, among others.

%TODO: Gaia
As one of the most famous, the Gaia middleware is designed to facilitate the construction of applications for IE. It consists of a set of core services and a framework for building distributed context aware applications. The Gaia embraces many goals that include the acquisition of context, the maintenance of hardware and software descriptions, mechanisms fo find resources and to compose context rules, among others.

It is easy to notice that the context information is a first concern topic in ubiquitous systems. But what is ``context''? Many authors have proposed definitions to this concept, though most are little accurate~\cite{baldauf2007survey}. Synthetizing previous definitions, Dey and Abowd have proposed that context is ``any information that can be used to characterize the situation of entities (i.e., whether a person, place or object) that are considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and the application themselves''~\cite{Dey2001}. In a IE ``Places'' are the rooms, the floors of a building, or spaces in general that enable the localization of other entities, ``People'' are individuals that populate the environment and interact with it, and ``things'' are virtual representations of physical objects or software components.

Context aware (or context sensible) applications is a designation to those applications that not only are capable of knowing the context of the environment, but also react to it either by means of changing the environment or in a software level.

\section{Framework} \label{sec:framework}
[framework description] 

% O framework provê facilidades e padrões de programação tipicamente requeridos em aplicações sensíveis ao contexto focadas em AmbI. Dentre as facilidades está a capacidade de abstrair detalhes das partes da aplicação que envolve a comunicação, a aquisição de contexto e a localização de recursos. Como abstração aos recursos são utilizados componentes chamados Agentes de Recursos (AR). O AR é a unidade básica de modularização do \textit{framework }, sendo utilizado na modelagem, implementação e gerenciamento das aplicações. Por exemplo: sensores de temperatura da casa, de vazamento de gás na cozinha, um medidor de pressão arterial, um atuador para fechar as janelas, etc. 


[we have implemented most of the framework features, thought much more remain to be done]

\subsection{Resource Agents}
% [resource]
% A resource may be defined as any hardware or software entity that exposes services which can be used by other entities and applications present in IE. Thus, sensors, actuators and smart devices (e.g. stove, fridge, air-conditioning) fall within this definition. For example, a light bulb can expose a service to get its current state (either on or off) and another to effectively turn it on and off. A software module that monitors all these light bulbs turned on, deduce the power consumption and expose this information is also an example of resource.

The Resource Agents (RA) can be understood as entities that represent resources, which are sensors, actuators, devices, and smart appliances, as well as software modules that provide a service to the environment. The RAs encapsulate the specificities of resources and expose their information to the environment through standard interfaces, so that others can access them uniformly reducing the complexity of integration. For example, details of data collection from a temperature sensor would be known only by their RA, which is responsible for providing a simple interface to other system components.
%it's similar to the widget of the context toolkit
%enjoys benefits of SOA

The RA concept meets the first challente (i), related to the devices heterogeneity.
